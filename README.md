Title: prior sparse group MCP. Description: psgMCP is a penalization method for high-dimensional gene-environment (G-E) interaction identification incorporating prior information from published literatures. This method adopts a quasi-likelihood based function to obtain a  balance between the observations and prior information. For main gene and G-E interaction identification, the sparse group MCP penalty is adopted under a joint statistical modeling framework.
