Title: prior sparse group MCP. Description: psgMCP is a penalization method for high-dimensional Gene-environment (G-E) interaction identification incorporating prior information from existing literatures. This method adopts a quasi-likelihood based function to balance between the observations and prior information. For main gene effects and G-E interactions identification, the sparse group MCP penalty is adopted under a joint statistical modelling framework.
